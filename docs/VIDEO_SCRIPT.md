# DatasetDoctor - Demo Video Script (3 Minutes)

## Video Structure

**Total Duration: 3 minutes**

---

## Segment 1: Problem Statement (30 seconds)

### Visuals:
- Show messy dataset (CSV with missing values, wrong types, duplicates)
- Highlight data quality issues
- Show impact: "Bad data = Bad decisions"

### Script:
> "Data quality issues are everywhere. Missing values, wrong data types, duplicates - these problems make your data unreliable and lead to poor decisions. Manual cleaning is time-consuming and error-prone. What if AI could do it for you?"

---

## Segment 2: Solution Overview (30 seconds)

### Visuals:
- DatasetDoctor logo/interface
- Show the web UI
- Highlight key features

### Script:
> "Meet DatasetDoctor - an AI-powered multi-agent system that automatically diagnoses and fixes data quality issues. Just upload your dataset, and our specialized AI agents work together to clean it. You get a cleaned dataset, detailed reports, and a Python script - all automatically."

---

## Segment 3: Architecture (45 seconds)

### Visuals:
- Architecture diagram (animated)
- Show agent workflow:
  - Ingestor → Scanner → Fixer → Validator → Reporter
- Highlight multi-agent coordination

### Script:
> "DatasetDoctor uses a multi-agent architecture. Each agent has a specialized role: The Ingestor loads your data, the Scanner finds issues, the Fixer applies fixes, the Validator ensures quality, and the Reporter generates comprehensive reports. They communicate using the A2A protocol and use 14 MCP-compliant tools. Everything is observable with logging, tracing, and metrics."

---

## Segment 4: Live Demo (60 seconds)

### Visuals:
- Screen recording of actual usage:
  1. Open browser → http://localhost:5000
  2. Upload sample_messy_data.csv
  3. Show loading animation with progress steps
  4. Show results:
     - Quality score improvement
     - Issues detected
     - Fixes applied
     - Download options
  5. Show generated HTML report
  6. Show cleaned dataset

### Script:
> "Let's see it in action. I'll upload a messy dataset with missing values, type errors, and duplicates. Watch as DatasetDoctor scans, fixes, and validates. In seconds, we have a clean dataset with a quality score improvement from 65% to 95%. You can download the cleaned data, view detailed reports, or get a Python script to reproduce the cleaning."
